```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo =TRUE)
```


This is some test code to see how it looks. 

```{r}


write_alt_text <- function(
  chart_type, 
  type_of_data, 
  reason, 
  source
  ){
  glue::glue(
    "{chart_type} of {type_of_data} where {reason}. \n\nData source from {source}"
    )
}

write_alt_text(
  "Bar Chart", 
  "tweets from the past week tagged with the TidyTuesday hashtag", 
  "Tuesday is the most popular day to post tweets, although about 20-30 tweets are posted every day", 
  "the {rtweet} package."
  )
